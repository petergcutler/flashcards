# Flashcards

## Basic Requirements:

Render in the browser
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy online, using Github Project pages.
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


## Necessary Deliverables

A hosted copy of your game or app, built by you, hosted on Github pages.
Your HTML/CSS should pass the HTML5 Validator and CSS Validators
A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.


## Project Description

Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through them quickly (back or front), and use the keyboard flip the card, and to mark whether they got it right or not. Track which cards were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them right!

### Bonus:

Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)


## User Stories:

As a user, I want to be able to be able to browse flashcards by "question" or "answer" to deepen understanding of topics.

As a user, I want my flipping experience to be animated but quick (< 400ms) for a more meaningful and tactile user experience.

As a user, I want to be able to use my keyboard to trigger the card flips for more control and easier/speedier input.

As a user, I want to be able to mark whether or not I got my flashcard correct for better tracking/analysis of my performance.

As a user, I want to be able to sort the cards I answered incorrectly so that I may specifically repeat those cards.
